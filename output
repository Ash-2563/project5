ðŸ“Š Task 1: Student Pass/Fail Prediction

Model Used: Logistic Regression
Input Features:

Study Hours (hours per week)
Attendance (% of classes attended)
Target Variable:
Pass(1 = Pass, 0 = Fail)

ðŸ“ˆ Accuracy:
85% (on test data)

ðŸ§® Confusion Matrix:

```
[[ 4  2 ]
 [ 1 13 ]]
```

Interpretation:

True Negatives (4): Correctly predicted fails.
True Positives (13): Correctly predicted passes.
False Positives (2): Incorrectly predicted passes (actually failed).
False Negatives (1): Incorrectly predicted fails (actually passed).

 ðŸ’¬ Task 2: Sentiment Analysis (NLP)

Model Used: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF
Preprocessing Steps:

* Lowercased text
* Removed punctuation and special characters
* TF-IDF vectorized

Sample Dataset: 10 simple reviews (5 positive, 5 negative)

ðŸ“ˆ Classification Report:

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       1.00      1.00      1.00         1
           1       1.00      1.00      1.00         1

    accuracy                           1.00         2
   macro avg       1.00      1.00      1.00         2
weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00         2
```

Interpretation:

* The model performed perfectly on the small test set.
* TF-IDF successfully captured the sentiment-indicative words like "love", "worst", "fantastic", and "terrible".
