Task 1: Student Pass/Fail Prediction focuses on building a classification model to determine whether a student will pass or fail based on two key academic indicators: the number of hours they study per week and their class attendance percentage. Using logistic regression, this task models the probability of a student passing (represented as 1) or failing (represented as 0). The goal is to explore the relationship between these input features and academic success, allowing educators or institutions to identify at-risk students early. The task involves generating or selecting a dataset with the relevant features, conducting exploratory data analysis to visualize trends, training the model, and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix to assess prediction reliability.

Task 2: Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing aims to classify customer reviews as either positive or negative. It involves processing raw textual data—such as cleaning, lowercasing, and removing punctuation—and transforming the text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). A logistic regression model is then trained on this vectorized text to predict sentiment labels. The model’s effectiveness is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive view of its performance. This task is especially useful in real-world applications like customer feedback analysis, enabling businesses to understand user opinions and improve services accordingly.
